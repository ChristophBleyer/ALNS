## Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search applied to technician vehicle routing

ALNS (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search) initially forked from [here](https://github.com/N-Wouda/ALNS) applied to a real-world problem arising in technician vehicle routing. This project models the operational planning of technicians which the ALNS algorithm can interact with. The ALNS algorithm then minimizes the costs arising from:

* Unvisited customers depending on their expected profit
* Vehicle abrasion and fuel
* Overtime depending on the vehicle

An exact mathematical formulation that has developed for this project can be found [here](docs/Problem.pdf).
